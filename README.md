## Background:
This app was initially developed in 2020 to support a friend who was facing challenges related to eating disorders. NutriBuddy is a straightforward app with basic functionality, offering a helping hand in a humorous and relatable way. It was crafted using Unity version 2021.3.4f1; please note that future Unity releases may not guarantee the app's proper functioning.

## Discleamer
This application was developed when I was just 15 years old and was not initially intended for sharing. Given my limited experience at the time, the code could be improved, and it's worth noting that no comments have been included.
